# BullFightingGameC-
As a part of our Semester 3 Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Course we created a Bull Fighting Game using C++. This is an interactive game where the user needs to defend 
himself from the Bull and at the same time make attempts to kill te Bull. The game has been designed using C++ Programming language. A UML diagram has also been included
in the repository which can be used to understand the flow of the program. We have ensured that all OOP concepts are covered through this code.
